# Projeto-Final-de-Graduacao
This is a final graduation project with objective of predicting energy consumption on neural networks when they are run on a raspberry pi. 

All the test that were done are in here and more data is also avaliable for use in the folder, but when using it only use the ones that are more recent in each neural network.
